# Getting and Cleaning Data: Class Project #

This is the course project for the Coursera data science specialization track's "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

## Files ##
* CodeBook.md: A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.
* README.md: This file.
* run_analysis.R: Script to run the analysis and generate the desired output for the project.
* subject_activity_averages.txt: Output file with averages grouped by subject and activity.

## How to run ##
1. Download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip to the directory containing run_analysis.R
2. Unzip the data file. It will create a directory "UCI HAR Dataset/"
3. Run the run_analysis.R script from where you are. It will detect the "UCI HAR Dataset/" directory and perform analysis.
4. Grab the generated subject_activity_averages.txt file that is generated.
