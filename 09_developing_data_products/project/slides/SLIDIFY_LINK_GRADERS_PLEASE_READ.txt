Hello,

Before submitting my project, I was showing it off to some friends over Facebook.

Stupidly, when I submitted it, I actually copy-pasted the link straight out of facebook, so instead of the raw link, I submitted the facebook pass-through link.

If you're logged into facebook, it probably just works transparently. However, here's the real link just in case:
